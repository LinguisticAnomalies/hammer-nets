### Layer Combinations with 50% Attention Heads Zeroed

Layer 0:1:2:3:4:8:10

| Dataset  | c-d  | c/d  | log(c) - log(d)  |
|---|---|---|---|
| ADReSS training set  |  0.685 | **0.713**  |  0.713  |
| ADReSS test set  | 0.747  |  **0.901**  | 0.901  |

but that can't be back off a and down they're gonna go off it just go on the go to go up and up go on go it go like a man is a man you and you a man man and man. You know, you love, you know, you know she knows to find something or you, you want to love that there is something


### Layer Combinations with 100% Attention Heads Zeroed

 to give the other than any time that is when it is the guy has the main, but it's "he has the main is getting her.
