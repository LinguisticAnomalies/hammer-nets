There are two children and their mother in the kitchen.	 They have no idea what's going on, but they do know that there is something wrong with them.	 They have no idea what's going on, but they do know that there is something wrong with them.
The little boy has climbed up, on a three legged stool to get some cookies from the jar in the cupboard.	 I'm so glad I did it, he says with an air of pride about his new life and how much better things are for him now than they were before.

The stool is about to fall over, so he’s probably going to fall on the floor.	 He doesn't know how long it will take for him and his friends (who are all in their thirties at this point), but they're not too far away from where I'm standing right now—and there's a lot of people around here who have been watching me go down that stairs with my hands up as if we were walking through an open field or something like	 He doesn't know how long it will take for him and his friends (who are all in their thirties at this point), but they're not too far away from where I'm standing right now—and there's a lot of people around here who have been watching me go down that stairs with my hands up as if we were walking through an open field or something like
His sister is holding up one hand as if she is waiting for him to pass her some of the cookies, and she’s holding a finger to her mouth as if to warn her brother to be quiet.	 I don't know what you're talking about, he says with an annoyed look on his face; but it's not like I've ever been in this situation before. He looks down at Ruby who has just returned from school after having spent so much time together that they have never seen each other more than once during their entire lives—a fact which makes them both very happy when things are going well but also extremely sad whenever something goes wrong or bad comes right back into play.[1] The two girls' faces change slightly every few seconds,[2][citation needed]. They begin laughing hysterically[3], even though there were no words being spoken by anyone else besides themselves (which would explain why Weiss was crying out loud).

Meanwhile their mother is taking no notice.	 I don't know what's going on, she says, looking at her son with a smirk and an expression of relief that he has been able to keep his head above water for the last few days without being seen or heard from by anyone else in this town	 I don't know what's going on, she says, looking at her son with a smirk and an expression of relief that he has been able to keep his head above water for the last few days without being seen or heard from by anyone else in this town
She’s been doing the washing up and is now drying a plate.	 I'm not sure if he's going to do it again, but we'll see what happens with him next week.	 I'm not sure if he's going to do it again, but we'll see what happens with him next week.
She has left the tap running and the sink is overflowing.

There is a big puddle on the floor, and she’s standing in it.	 She doesn't know what to do with her hands or feet; they're too small for this kind of thing—she's not even sure if there are any other things that can be done.

She seems not to have noticed either the water or what her children are doing.	 I don't know if it's because I'm too busy with my kids, but they're in a different place, she told The Daily Caller News Foundation by phone last week after being asked for comment on an article that was published earlier this month about how much money is going into Planned Parenthood of America (PPA) and other abortion-related organizations such as Family Planning International Inc., which has more than	 I don't know if it's because I'm too busy with my kids, but they're in a different place, she told The Daily Caller News Foundation by phone last week after being asked for comment on an article that was published earlier this month about how much money is going into Planned Parenthood of America (PPA) and other abortion-related organizations such as Family Planning International Inc., which has more than

It seems to be summer, as she is wearing a short sleeved dress under her apron.	 I don't know if it's because of the weather or something else.
