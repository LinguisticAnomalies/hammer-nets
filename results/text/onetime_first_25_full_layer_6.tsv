I don't know what you're talking about, he says with an exasperated look on his face; but it's not like I'm going anywhere right now. He looks down at himself in confusion before turning back towards Elsa who has just finished eating something that was left over from last time they had spent together after their first date earlier this year (she still seems very happy).
