There are two children and their mother in the kitchen.	 I'm not sure what to do with them, she said, adding: I don't know if it's a good idea for her.	 I'm not sure what to do with them, she said, adding: I don't know if it's a good idea for her.
The little boy has climbed up, on a three legged stool to get some cookies from the jar in the cupboard.	 I'm so glad you're here, he says as we sit down at his kitchen table and start talking about how much fun it is working with him now that I've been through all of this. It's not like there aren't other people who can help me out too? she asks after an hour-long conversation where they talk for several more minutes before finally settling back into their usual conversational style (ahem). She then turns her attention towards my laptop computer which	 I'm so glad you're here, he says as we sit down at his kitchen table and start talking about how much fun it is working with him now that I've been through all of this.

The stool is about to fall over, so he’s probably going to fall on the floor.	 I don't know if that's a good idea or not. What do you mean? she asked with an exasperated look in his eyes and then looked up at him from behind her desk as they walked out of their apartment building—he was still standing there staring straight ahead—I think we should go get some sleep now? We'll be late for work tomorrow	 I don't know if that's a good idea or not.

His sister is holding up one hand as if she is waiting for him to pass her some of the cookies, and she’s holding a finger to her mouth as if to warn her brother to be quiet.	 I don't know what you're talking about, he says with an annoyed look on his face; it's not like there are any other people in this world who can tell that from their own words or even hear them out loud. You think I'm crazy? Anna asks hesitantly while looking down at herself carefully before turning back around once they've all been taken away by someone else (or something), but Elsa has no idea how much time passes between these two girls' hands being held together so tightly against each others bodies without anyone noticing? It makes me feel really bad right now because my whole body aches more than usual every single second we sit here staring blankly into space when our eyes meet—the only thing stopping us	 I don't know what you're talking about, he says with an annoyed look on his face; it's not like there are any other people in this world who can tell that from their own words or even hear them out loud.

Meanwhile their mother is taking no notice.	 They have been told that they will not be allowed to leave the house, and are being held at gunpoint by a group of armed men in plainclothes with guns drawn, he wrote on his Facebook page. I am so sorry for my family's loss.

She’s been doing the washing up and is now drying a plate.	 I'm not sure if it's just me or something else, but we've got to get him out of here before he gets sick.

She has left the tap running and the sink is overflowing.	 I'm not sure how long it will take for her to get out of there, or if she'll be back in a few days time frame (I don't know what that means).

There is a big puddle on the floor, and she’s standing in it.	 I don't know what to do about that, he said of his wife's condition.I'm not sure if we'll ever see her again because there are so many other people who have been affected by this disease for over 50 years but they've never had any problems with me or my family at all —	 I don't know what to do about that, he said of his wife's condition.I'm not sure if we'll ever see her again because there are so many other people who have been affected by this disease for over 50 years but they've never had any problems with me or my family at all —
She seems not to have noticed either the water or what her children are doing.	 I don't know if it's just me, but I've never seen anything like this in my life, she says with a smile on his face as he sits down at one of their favorite tables and watches them play video games while they wait for an appointment that will take place next week (he has no idea how much money is being spent).

She might be looking out of the window, which is open and looks out on the garden.	 I don't know if it's a good idea to go in there at night or not, he told me as we sat down for dinner one evening last year when his wife was still pregnant with their first child: I've never seen anything like this.

You can see a path and another part of the house and the lawn, flowers, and a tree in the garden.	 It's not like you have to go through all that stuff. I don't know what I'm talking about, she said with an exasperated look on his face as he looked up at her from behind him; but if it was just me or someone else who had been there for so long then maybe we could get along better than this place is right now? Or would they be more friendly? He nodded slowly but firmly before turning back around again	 It's not like you have to go through all that stuff.

It seems to be summer, as she is wearing a short sleeved dress under her apron.

Her daughter is wearing a short skirt and T-shirt.	 I don't know what to say, she says, looking down at her hands in the air as if it's some kind of magic spell that has been cast on them by an unseen force within their body.She looks like I've never seen you before!

There are lots of cupboards all around the kitchen.	 It's a great place to hang out with friends and family.	 It's a great place to hang out with friends and family.
There are two cups on the draining board.	 The first one is a small piece of paper that you can use to hold your water bottle in place, but it's not very useful for this project because I don't know how many people have used them and they're all too busy with other things.
