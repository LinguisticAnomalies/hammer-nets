There are two children and their mother in the kitchen.	 I'm not sure what they're doing, but it looks like she's trying to get them out of there.	 I'm not sure what they're doing, but it looks like she's trying to get them out of there.
The little boy has climbed up, on a three legged stool to get some cookies from the jar in the cupboard.	 I'm not sure if it's just me or something else, he says with an air of mystery and wonderment that is almost too much for his own good. What do you think? I ask him as we sit down at our table next door; there are so many people here who have never seen anything like this before! He looks over my shoulder: they're all very nice guys! They've always had their eyes open wide-eyed when talking about how great these	 I'm not sure if it's just me or something else, he says with an air of mystery and wonderment that is almost too much for his own good.

The stool is about to fall over, so he’s probably going to fall on the floor.	 I don't know if that's a good idea or not. What do you mean by 'good ideas'? What are they?

His sister is holding up one hand as if she is waiting for him to pass her some of the cookies, and she’s holding a finger to her mouth as if to warn her brother to be quiet.	 I don't know what you're talking about, he says with an exasperated look on his face; but it's not like I've ever been in this position before. He looks down at me from behind my back so that we can all see each other without being seen by anyone else but myself (he has no idea how many people there are around here). His eyes go wide when they meet our gaze—and then slowly turn into something much more sinister than just staring straight through their glasses or watching them fall silent while others stare blankly between us until someone comes along who makes sure everyone knows exactly where everything will end…	 I don't know what you're talking about, he says with an exasperated look on his face; but it's not like I've ever been in this position before.

Meanwhile their mother is taking no notice.	 I don't know what's going on, she says with a laugh, as if to say something about the fact that they've been living in this house for so long and have never seen anything like it before.

She’s been doing the washing up and is now drying a plate.	 I'm not sure if he's going to do it, but we'll see what happens with him.

She has left the tap running and the sink is overflowing.	 I'm not sure what to do with it, but we'll see how that plays out in a few weeks. I don't know about you guys, he said when asked if there's any chance of him getting back on his feet after this season because we're going through some pretty tough times right now.

There is a big puddle on the floor, and she’s standing in it.	 She looks up at me with an expression that I can't help but think of—she's not going to be happy about this.

She seems not to have noticed either the water or what her children are doing.	 I don't know if it's because I'm afraid of them, she says with a laugh, and then laughs again when asked about how much money they've spent on food for their three-day stay in New York City this week (they're spending $1 million each). She adds that there is no reason why anyone should spend more than half an hour every day at one place—it would be	 I don't know if it's because I'm afraid of them, she says with a laugh, and then laughs again when asked about how much money they've spent on food for their three-day stay in New York City this week (they're spending $1 million each).

She might be looking out of the window, which is open and looks out on the garden.	 I don't know if it's a good idea to go in there or not.

You can see a path and another part of the house and the lawn, flowers, and a tree in the garden.	 It's not like you have to go through all that stuff, he said.I don't know what I'm doing with my life right now because there are so many different things going on around me at this point but it is very important for us as people who love our country we should always be open-minded about how they live their lives.We've had some really bad experiences over time which has been pretty much wiped out by government policies since then,'' she	 It's not like you have to go through all that stuff, he said.I don't know what I'm doing with my life right now because there are so many different things going on around me at this point but it is very important for us as people who love our country we should always be open-minded about how they live their lives.We've had some really bad experiences over time which has been pretty much wiped out by government policies since then,'' she
It seems to be summer, as she is wearing a short sleeved dress under her apron.	 I don't know if it's because I'm tired of being in the same room with you or not. She looks up at me from behind my back and says something that sounds like an apology for what happened last time we went out on our honeymoon together (she has no idea how long ago this was).
