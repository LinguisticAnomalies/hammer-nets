The little boy has climbed up, on a three legged stool to get some cookies from the jar in the cupboard.	 I'm so glad I did it, he says with an air of self-deprecation that makes you wonder if this is just another day at work or something more personal for him and his family.

The stool is about to fall over, so he’s probably going to fall on the floor.	 I don't know if that's a good idea or not. I think you're right, she said with an annoyed look in her eyes as they both looked at each other and then away from one another for quite some time before looking back up into his face again (he was still breathing hard now).

His sister is holding up one hand as if she is waiting for him to pass her some of the cookies, and she’s holding a finger to her mouth as if to warn her brother to be quiet.	 I don't know what you're talking about, he says with an annoyed look on his face; but it's not like I've ever been in this situation before. He looks down at Anna who has no idea how much longer they can hold their hands together now that things are going so well between them… but then again there was never any such thing! She just kept saying 'no' all those years ago when we were still friends (and had always known each other better than anyone else), which made me feel even more guilty right after our first date because my heart aches every time something bad happens around us or someone gets hurt by another human being/human-like creature from somewhere far away... It really does make sense	 I don't know what you're talking about, he says with an annoyed look on his face; but it's not like I've ever been in this situation before.

She’s been doing the washing up and is now drying a plate.	 I'm not sure what to do with her, but it seems like she's got some sort of problem or something that needs attention from me right?

She has left the tap running and the sink is overflowing.	 I'm not sure how long it will take for her to get out of there, or if she'll be back in a few days' time (I don't know what that's like at this point), but we're pretty much on our own right now.

There is a big puddle on the floor, and she’s standing in it.	 I'm not sure what to do about that, he said of his wife's condition.I don't know if we should be doing this for our kids because they're going through so much pain right now...but at least you've got your hands full with these little girls who are still growing up!

She might be looking out of the window, which is open and looks out on the garden.	 I'm not sure if it's a good idea for her to go in there now that she can't see me.

You can see a path and another part of the house and the lawn, flowers, and a tree in the garden.
