The little boy has climbed up, on a three legged stool to get some cookies from the jar in the cupboard.	 I'm not sure if it's just me or him, he says with an exasperated look at his friend who is standing by and watching as they take their first bite of cookie dough before heading out for lunch later that afternoon. You know what? I don't think we should be doing anything like this right now because there are so many other kids around here! The two boys start talking about how much better life would have been without them but then suddenly realize something else: They	 I don't know if it's true or not but we're talking about an hour and 40 minutes ago when he was at home with his mom who had just been out of work for two days).

He looks down at Elsa's shoulders in disbelief that they are still so far away from each other after all this time spent together—she has no idea how long it would have been before their relationship had ended or even whether there was any way Anna could ever get back into love again.[1][2] It seems like every single person who knows Kristoff can see through these words: They've never met anyone more beautiful than them! And yet…they both seem very much alike...[3]. The only difference between those two people? Their personalities were completely different (even though	 I don't know what you're talking about, he says with an exasperated look on his face), but I'm sure it's true.
Meanwhile their mother is taking no notice.	 I don't know what's going on, she says, looking at her son in the eye as if to say: 'You're not a good boy.'
