The little boy has climbed up, on a three legged stool to get some cookies from the jar in the cupboard.	 I'm so glad you're here, he says as we sit down at his kitchen table and watch him play with one of our favorite treats: an apple pie that's been sitting there for about two weeks now! Oh my gosh! I say cheerfully after seeing how much fun it is eating this delicious treat (and not just because they've made me feel good). He looks around nervously before turning back towards us; no matter what happens next…he'll be right	 I'm so glad you're here, he says as we sit down at his kitchen table and watch him play with one of our favorite treats: an apple pie that's been sitting there for about two weeks now!

The stool is about to fall over, so he’s probably going to fall on the floor.	 I don't know if that's a good idea or not.

His sister is holding up one hand as if she is waiting for him to pass her some of the cookies, and she’s holding a finger to her mouth as if to warn her brother to be quiet.	 I don't know what you're talking about, he says with an exasperated look on his face; but I'm sure it's not your fault that we've been here so long. He looks down at himself in embarrassment before turning away from Elsa who has just finished eating them all while staring into their eyes like they have no idea how much time had passed since last seeing each other or why Anna was still standing there by herself when this whole thing started going off without any real explanation whatsoever (she seems really upset right now). She turns back around but then suddenly stops moving once more after saying something which makes me feel very bad because my heart aches even harder than usual every few seconds until finally… well... nothing happened?

Meanwhile their mother is taking no notice.

She’s been doing the washing up and is now drying a plate.	 I'm not sure if it's just me or something else, but she seems to be getting better every day.

She seems not to have noticed either the water or what her children are doing.	 I don't know if it's because I'm afraid of them, she says, and then pauses for a moment before saying something that makes me feel better about my own situation: She has no idea how much money is being spent on these kids' education programs at this point in their lives—or whether they will ever get any help from those who would otherwise be spending more than $1 million per year	 I don't know if it's because I'm afraid of them, she says, and then pauses for a moment before saying something that makes me feel better about my own situation: She has no idea how much money is being spent on these kids' education programs at this point in their lives—or whether they will ever get any help from those who would otherwise be spending more than $1 million per year
