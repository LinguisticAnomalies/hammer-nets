The little boy has climbed up, on a three legged stool to get some cookies from the jar in the cupboard.	 It's been so long since I've had one of those things that you just can't help but think about it. I'm not sure how much longer he'll be here, she said with an airy smile as they sat down at their table and watched him eat his first cookie before heading out for another bite or two later when her husband came back into town after work (he'd never done anything like this).

His sister is holding up one hand as if she is waiting for him to pass her some of the cookies, and she’s holding a finger to her mouth as if to warn her brother to be quiet.	 I don't know what you're talking about, he says with an exasperated look on his face; but it's not like I'm going anywhere without your help. He looks down at himself in confusion before turning back towards Elsa who has just finished eating another cookie that was left over from last time they had been together so much more than two years ago when their parents were still living out there somewhere between New York City (the same place where Kristoff would have gotten married). She turns around but finds herself staring blankly into space while Anna stares straight ahead behind them wondering how this could possibly go any other way...

It seems to be summer, as she is wearing a short sleeved dress under her apron.	 It's not the first time that I've seen this kind of outfit in my life and it looks like something you'd expect from someone who doesn't have much experience with fashion (I'm sure there are many more).
