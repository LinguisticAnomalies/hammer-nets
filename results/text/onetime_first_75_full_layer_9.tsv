There are two children and their mother in the kitchen.	 I'm not sure what to do with them, she said, adding: I don't know if it's a good idea.	 I'm not sure what to do with them, she said, adding: I don't know if it's a good idea.
The little boy has climbed up, on a three legged stool to get some cookies from the jar in the cupboard.	 He looks at me and says: 'I'm sorry I didn't know you were there.'  It's not like we're going anywhere, he said of his new life as an actor.We've been doing this for so long that it makes no difference what your name is or how many people are watching us because they'll never see our face again.

The stool is about to fall over, so he’s probably going to fall on the floor.	 I don't know if that's a good idea or not. What do you mean by 'good enough'? she asked with an exasperated look in her eyes as they both looked at each other for what seemed like hours before finally settling back into their seats and sitting down again after eating lunch together (which was pretty much all of them).

I don't know what you're talking about, he says with an exasperated look on his face; it's not like there are any other people in this world who would ever think that they could do something so stupid or mean-spirited without being seen by anyone else. She looks down at herself before looking away from me again when I ask how much time has passed since we've been together? Her eyes dart across my shoulder once more—she must have had no idea where our conversation was going after all these years ago! It seems almost too late now! You were just saying 'no,' right? My voice trails off into incoherent monologues—What did your father say?'—and then back out onto another side	 I don't know what you're talking about, he says with an exasperated look on his face; it's not like there are any other people in this world who would ever think that they could do something so stupid or mean-spirited without being seen by anyone else.

Meanwhile their mother is taking no notice.	 I don't know what's going on, she says, looking at her daughter in the eye as if to say: 'What are you talking about? You're not a good person.'

She’s been doing the washing up and is now drying a plate.	 I'm not sure if it's just me or something else, but she seems to be getting better at her job as well.

There is a big puddle on the floor, and she’s standing in it.	 She looks up at me as if to say: I'm sorry I didn't know you were there.

She seems not to have noticed either the water or what her children are doing.	 I don't know if it's just me, but I've never seen anything like this in my life, she told The Associated Press last month when asked about a recent incident at an elementary school that left one student dead and two others injured after they were hit with rocks thrown by students on their way home from work (see video below).

I don't know if it's a good idea to go in there or not, she said as we sat down at her kitchen table with our dinner prepared for us by an old friend who had recently moved from New York City when he was just starting his own business: I've never seen anything like this before.

It seems to be summer, as she is wearing a short sleeved dress under her apron.	 She looks at me and says I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not sure if it's because of the cold weather or something else but when we get home from work on Sunday morning there are so many people in our house who look like they've just been through some tough times with their kids (they have no idea how much time has passed since then).
