There are two children and their mother in the kitchen.	 I'm not sure what to do with them, she said, adding: I don't know if it's a good idea.	 I'm not sure what to do with them, she said, adding: I don't know if it's a good idea.
The little boy has climbed up, on a three legged stool to get some cookies from the jar in the cupboard.	 I'm so glad you're here, he says as we sit down at his kitchen table and watch him play with one of our favorite treats: chocolate chip cookie doughnuts! Oh my gosh! I say excitedly after eating them for breakfast; they've been sitting there all day without me even knowing it was coming… but now that this is happening? It's not like she doesn't know what her kids will be doing next week or how many days until school starts	 I'm so glad you're here, he says as we sit down at his kitchen table and watch him play with one of our favorite treats: chocolate chip cookie doughnuts!

The stool is about to fall over, so he’s probably going to fall on the floor.

His sister is holding up one hand as if she is waiting for him to pass her some of the cookies, and she’s holding a finger to her mouth as if to warn her brother to be quiet.	 She doesn't know how long he's been in this world but it seems like every time they go out together there are more than enough people around them who can tell their own stories about what went down on that fateful day when his mother was murdered by an unknown assailant (or at least I think so). I'm not really sure why anyone would ever do such things...but maybe because we're all too familiar with each other? It makes you feel good knowing someone else has done something similar before or after your parents' deaths....and even though my mom never told me anything along those lines..she did say you should have known better, which probably made sense since our family had gone through very difficult times while still living under different circumstances from	 She doesn't know how long he's been in this world but it seems like every time they go out together there are more than enough people around them who can tell their own stories about what went down on that fateful day when his mother was murdered by an unknown assailant (or at least I think so).

She has left the tap running and the sink is overflowing.	 I'm not sure how long it will take me to get out of here, but at least we'll be back in a few hours or so!

She might be looking out of the window, which is open and looks out on the garden.	 I don't know if it's a good idea to go in there at night or not. I think you're right about that, she said with an amused smile before turning her head away from him as he turned his attention back towards their car parked near where they'd been waiting for some time now?
