I don't know what you're talking about, he says with an exasperated look on his face; but it's not like I've ever been in this situation before. He looks down at me from behind my back so that we can all see each other without being seen or heard by anyone else around us (he has no idea how many people there are who have had their eyes gouged out because they were too busy watching TV).

She has left the tap running and the sink is overflowing.	 I'm not sure what to do with her, but it's a good thing she doesn't have any friends in this town.
