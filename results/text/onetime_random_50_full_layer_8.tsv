There are two children and their mother in the kitchen.	 I'm not sure what to do with them, but it's a good thing that they're safe.	 I'm not sure what to do with them, but it's a good thing that they're safe.
The little boy has climbed up, on a three legged stool to get some cookies from the jar in the cupboard.	 I'm so glad you're here, he says as we sit down at his kitchen table and watch him play with one of our favorite toys—a toy that looks like it was made by someone who had been there for years. He's not sure if I've ever seen such an amazing thing before or whether this is just another daydreaming about my own childhood dream come true… but then again what else could possibly go wrong?

The stool is about to fall over, so he’s probably going to fall on the floor.	 I don't know if that's a good idea or not but it looks like there was some sort of altercation between him and his wife at one point. He added: I've never seen this happen before in my life… It just seems too much for someone who has been through such an emotional rollercoaster when they're dealing with their own personal issues as well	 I don't know if that's a good idea or not but it looks like there was some sort of altercation between him and his wife at one point.

His sister is holding up one hand as if she is waiting for him to pass her some of the cookies, and she’s holding a finger to her mouth as if to warn her brother to be quiet.	 I don't know what you're talking about, he says with an exasperated look on his face; but I'm sure it's not all that bad. He looks down at himself in confusion before turning away from me while looking into my eyes again...and this time there was no way we could have done anything better than keep our hands off each other until they were completely exhausted by their own exhaustion! And then suddenly something happened which made them both start laughing hysterically (or maybe just giggling). It seemed like everything had been going so well since those last few days but now things started getting really weird when someone else came along who looked quite different - or perhaps even more bizarrely odd-looking?

Meanwhile their mother is taking no notice.	 I don't know what's going on here, she says, looking at me with a smirk as I walk out of the house and into my room to see if there are any other people in this world who can help us find our way back home.

She’s been doing the washing up and is now drying a plate.	 I'm not sure if it's just me or something else, but she seems to be getting better at her job as well.

She has left the tap running and the sink is overflowing.	 I'm not sure what to do with her, but it seems like she's in a state of disrepair. I don't know how you feel about that, he said as we sat down at his kitchen table for dinner on Friday night (the next day).

There is a big puddle on the floor, and she’s standing in it.	 She looks up at me as if to say I'm sorry, but I don't know what that means or how much of an impact her words have had upon my relationship with this woman who has been through so many different things.

She seems not to have noticed either the water or what her children are doing.	 I don't know if it's because I'm afraid of them, she says, and then goes on about how they've been in a bad situation for so long that there is no one else who can help but themselves. They're just like any other family: you go out with your kids when things get really rough; we'll be back at work after school every day—we all	 I don't know if it's because I'm afraid of them, she says, and then goes on about how they've been in a bad situation for so long that there is no one else who can help but themselves.

She might be looking out of the window, which is open and looks out on the garden.	 I don't know if it's a good idea to go in there or not. I think you're right about that, she said with an amused look at me as we walked away from her house after our walk-in party had been over for some time; but what are your plans now? You've got two more days before they'll let us get back into town! She looked up	 I don't know if it's a good idea to go in there or not.

You can see a path and another part of the house and the lawn, flowers, and a tree in the garden.

It seems to be summer, as she is wearing a short sleeved dress under her apron.	 I don't know what's going on with you, says the woman in front of me who has never seen anything like it before. I'm not sure how much longer we'll have this conversation about our relationship or if there are any other things that can go wrong between us at some point and then come back later for another date!

Her son is wearing shorts a shirt and shoes and socks, which are also falling down.	 He says he has no idea what's going on in the house or how long it will take for him to get out of there.
