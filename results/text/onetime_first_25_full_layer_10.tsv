The little boy has climbed up, on a three legged stool to get some cookies from the jar in the cupboard.	 I'm so glad you're here, he says as they sit down at his table and watch him eat them. I don't know if it's true or not but we've been doing this for two years now! Oh my God! What is that? she asks with an exasperated look across her face like someone who had just gotten out of bed after having spent all day talking about how much better their lives were than theirs was?

The stool is about to fall over, so he’s probably going to fall on the floor.	 I don't know if that's a good idea or not. What do you mean? she asked with an annoyed look in her eyes as they both looked at each other for what seemed like hours before finally settling back into their seats and sitting down again after some time had gone by without any of them noticing him coming out from under his seat just moments ago?

His sister is holding up one hand as if she is waiting for him to pass her some of the cookies, and she’s holding a finger to her mouth as if to warn her brother to be quiet.	 I don't know what you're talking about, he says with an exasperated look on his face; but it's not like I've ever been in this situation before. He looks down at Anna who has just returned from work so that they can talk more freely but still have no idea where their conversation will take them next week or how much longer Elsa might stay here after all these years without being seen by any other family members (or even friends). She seems quite happy now because there are only two things left: getting back home again tomorrow morning when Kristoff comes out into town...and then having dinner tonight?

She’s been doing the washing up and is now drying a plate.	 I'm not sure if it's just me or something else, but she seems to be getting better every day.

She might be looking out of the window, which is open and looks out on the garden.	 I don't know if it's a good idea to go in there at night or not because you'll get hit by lightning, she says with an exasperated look that makes me think about how many times we've heard her say things like this: I'm so sorry for your loss.

It seems to be summer, as she is wearing a short sleeved dress under her apron.	 I'm not sure if it's because of the weather or something else.
